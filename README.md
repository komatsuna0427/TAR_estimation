## Threshold autoregressive model (TAR) estimation with R

This repository contains R codes that estimate the parameters of TAR model. In fact, there are R libraries that can estimat TAR such as ```tsDyn```. But the problem is that with the existing libraries, I cannot estimate the TAR model based on the arbitrage condition. So I decided to write R codes tailored to my own need.
